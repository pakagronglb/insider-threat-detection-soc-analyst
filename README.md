# Insider Threat Detection System üêû

A Python application that generates simulated logs and detects suspicious user behaviour patterns that may indicate insider threats.

## Features ‚ú®

- Simulates user logs including normal and suspicious activity patterns
- Detects various suspicious behaviors:
  - Mass downloads (unusual file sizes and high volume)
  - Off-hours access (activity outside normal working hours)
  - Cross-department resource access (users accessing resources from other departments)
  - Sensitive data access (accessing restricted files)
  - USB usage patterns
  - Email activity patterns
- Department/role-based analysis to identify suspicious access patterns
- Supervised learning with labeled data to identify known threat types:
  - Mass downloaders
  - Off-hours access
  - Privilege abuse (IT admins accessing HR/Finance data)
  - Data snooping (accessing data outside job responsibilities)
- Unsupervised learning for detecting novel anomalies
- Detailed threat type analysis and feature importance

## Setup üì¶

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. (Optional) Set up a DeepSeek API key in `.env` file for AI explanations:
   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application üöÄ

Simply run the main script which will:
1. Generate simulated log data
2. Process the logs to extract features
3. Detect anomalous behaviors
4. Save results to the outputs directory

```
python main.py
```

## Understanding the Results üìù

The application will output results to the console and save detailed findings to several files:

- `outputs/anomalies.json` - Detailed anomaly information
- `outputs/feature_importances.csv` - Which features are most important for detection
- `outputs/threat_analysis.csv` - Analysis of different threat types
- `outputs/threat_type_mapping.csv` - Mapping of threat type labels

The console output will show:
- Number of suspicious users detected
- User IDs, departments, and threat types of suspicious users
- Key metrics for each suspicious user:
  - Maximum file size downloaded
  - Percentage of off-hours access
  - Cross-department access percentage
  - Sensitive resource access percentage
  - Total data volume accessed
  - Confidence score (with supervised learning)
- Threat type analysis with probabilities
- Top features for detection

## Customisation ‚öôÔ∏è

You can modify the suspicious behavior thresholds and department definitions in:
- `src/ai_explainer.py` - For explanation thresholds 
- `generate_logs.py` - For simulating different suspicious patterns
- `src/feature_engineer.py` - For department-specific resource patterns
